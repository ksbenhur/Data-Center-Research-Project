A data center is a structure, a specific area inside a structure, or a collection of 
structures that hold computer systems and related parts like storage and 
telecommunications. 
Because IT operations are essential to business continuity, they typically comprise 
backup or redundant parts and infrastructure for data connectivity, power supply, 
environmental controls (such as fire suppression and air conditioning), and a variety 
of security systems. An industrial-scale operation, a major data center consumes as 
much electricity as a medium-sized town. In 2022, data centers were expected to use 
between 240 and 340 TWh of electricity, or about 1.3% of the world's total electricity 
demand. This excludes energy used for cryptocurrency mining, which was estimated 
to be around 110 TWh in 2022, or another 0.4% of global electricity demand. The IEA 
projects that data center electric use could double between 2022 and 2026. High 
demand for electricity from data centers, including by crypto mining and artificial 
intelligence, has also increased strain on local electric grids and increased electricity 
prices in some markets. 
Data centers can vary widely in terms of size, power requirements, redundancy, and 
overall structure. Four common categories used to segment types of data centers are 
onsite data centers, colocation facilities, hyperscale data centers, and edge data 
centers.  
Data centers trace their origins to the large computer rooms of the 1940s, such as 
those housing ENIAC. Early systems required extensive cabling, raised floors, and 
cooling mechanisms. As IT operations grew, companies recognized the need to 
centralize computing resources, leading to the emergence of dedicated data centers. 
The dot-com boom (1997–2000) accelerated this trend, driving the development of 
large-scale internet data centers. By the 2010s, cloud data centers became dominant, 
with global infrastructure spending reaching $200 billion in 2021. AI and machine 
learning have further shaped modern data centers, with demand for efficient, high
performance computing surging. The U.S. remains a global leader, hosting over 5,000 
data centers as of 2024, with demand projected to double by 2030.
